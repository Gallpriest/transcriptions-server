create a simple view which will show an input
where you can type in an english word and it will provide 
a transcription for it and several examples

-- Plan --

Views:
- index (input);
- history (all previous results)
- cheatsheet (table with transcription, rules)
- quiz game (make a guess game based on results)

Architecture:

frontend:
- NextJS
- Reshaped UI
- fetch caching

backend:
- golang webserver;
- routing system;
- no authorization (add later)
- Cache + parsing
